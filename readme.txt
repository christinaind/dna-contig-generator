In all operating systems: 
	Run the program using following command:
		python create_contig.py [filename]

An example run: python create_contig.py test-input.txt

Explanation: After you run the program it outputs the contigs.txt file that contains all related contigs line by line

PS: program definitely works in Python 3, it should also work in older versions but if there is an error due to syntax differences, I can immediately fix it with very slight changes.
